        "This project addresses the implementation of **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**, a population-based meta-heuristic algorithm designed to efficiently explore and exploit high-dimensional search spaces. PSO operates by maintaining a swarm of particles, each encoding a candidate solution in a continuous space, with particle states defined through their positional vectors and associated velocities. At each iteration, these particles update their velocities and positions, leveraging not only their own experience but also information shared among neighbors and the globally best-performing solution observed by the swarm.\n",
        "\n",
        "The implementation requires constructing a ParticleCandidate class, which represents individual particles as real-valued vectors bounded by user-defined limits and supports velocity-based state transitions. Core methods in this class generate random particle states within constraints, mutate them over time, and recombine solution vectors using stochastic coefficients and neighborhood information in accordance with the canonical PSO update rule:\n",

This class initializes a swarm of randomized particles, performs fitness-based updates of both individual and collective bests, dynamically samples neighbors, and applies the position and velocity updates in parallel across the population at each generation. The design strictly adheres to the interface and inheritance model required by the softpy library, ensuring compatibility and extensibility for further experimental research or practical optimization tasks.\n"
