# ParticleSwarmOptimizationProject
This project implements Particle Swarm Optimization, a population-based meta-heuristic algorithm designed to efficiently explore and exploit high-dimensional search spaces. PSO operates by maintaining a swarm of particles, each encoding a candidate solution, with states defined through positional vectors and associated velocities.
